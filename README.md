#Implementation details: Tested in R version 3.4.3
Dependencies:igraph and mvtnorm

Inputs:
  
Network: An `NxN` adjaceny matrix. It can be sparse
  
Attribute Mat: `NxP` vector of attributes, where p is the number of attributes you have
 
Prob: An indicator for wheether your attributes represent a probability of being in each of p communities. Use 0 if your attributes are not probabilities. 

Outputs: A list object with entries
  ```R
  $Comm: Node to community assignment
  
  $SBMProb: SBM probability parameters (between community probability matrix)
  
  $Mean: The mean of the Gaussian describing each community. This is a list object with each entry corresponding to the community of the index.
  
  $Cov: The covariance matrix describing each community. This is a list object with each entry corresponding to the community of the index.
  ```
  
  Example:
  
  ```R
  library('igraph')
  library('mvtnorm')
  source('FitAttribute.R')
  Out=FitAttribute(MyNet,MyAttribute,0)
  ```
